Hello.

Google Clone project for The Odin Project.

I can see that I would need to plan the naming system in a logical way so that the css is not a chaotic.

Need to align the search icon and get the hover status done, before finishing up with this Google Clone.

Still working on the magnifying glass as I did not want to use code it into the CSS as a bg image with no repeat.
Also the little grid icon hover is moving, figuring that one out next.
